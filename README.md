"This repository is intended for my school project and doesn't contain anything groundbreaking or significant. It's mainly a space for me to organize and share code related to coursework and assignments. Feel free to browse, but keep in mind that the content here is more focused on fulfilling academic requirements than on creating polished, production-level code. Nothing too important or impressive hereâ€”just a humble school project!"
